              blur effect is a creative tool to shift your composition, alter
              the feel of an image, provide a motion effect, or simply give you
              control of the focus of a picture. Use the photo blur effect to
              highlight or hide any element within the frame. By controlling
              your depth of field, you guide your viewer's focus to what matters
              most to you in your image.Every photo should draw the eye to
              something specific. Whether thatâ€™s a figure, building, message or
              some other element, blurring the extraneous details can help
              really emphasize that central focus. The go-to method for making
              something that truly pops out in photography requires adjusting
              the aperture settings on cameras.
